# National Trust Redesign App
A complete redesign prototype for the currently existing National Trust. This app was written in React Native using expo-go and uses data from the National Trust to pull location and event data and display it in the app.

## How To Run
 - Pull the repository into a local directory
 - Install npm dependencies via `npm i` command
 - Start the app using `npm expo start`
 - Run the app using the expo-go app on your mobile device, or run it through an emulator (Untested on iOS, Android is preferred)
