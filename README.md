# National Trust Redesign: A New Face for National Trust

Welcome to the National Trust Redesign App, a prototype built with a refined touch to enhance user interaction and overall experience with the National Trust. This application, built using React Native with expo-go, utilizes data from the National Trust to present location and event information within the app interface. This project served as a piece of coursework for a final year unit at my university.

## Overview

The redesigned app focuses on simplicity to minimize clutter and boost usability. Key features of the app include:

- **Bottom-Tab Navigation**: Easy navigation through the app is facilitated with two primary viewsâ€”Map View and List View.

- **Map View**: Here, users can find marked National Trust locations on a map. Each marked location is clickable for further details.

- **List View**: This presents a scrollable list of locations. Each location can be clicked for more information.

- **Search & Filter**: Both views incorporate search and filter functionalities, accessible via the buttons in the top-right corner of the interface, to provide a customized user experience.

For a more in-depth overview of the app, please refer to the comprehensive report provided in the repository root directory.

## Running the App

To get the National Trust Redesign app up and running on your local machine, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository into a local directory on your computer.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the cloned directory and install necessary npm dependencies by running the `npm i` command.

3. **Start the App**: Initiate the app using the `npm expo start` command.

4. **Run the App**: Execute the app using the expo-go app on your mobile device or via an emulator. Please note that the app has been primarily tested on Android devices, and iOS compatibility might be limited.
